* The file goes in the `/notarynodes/TEAMNAME/` directory.

Fork the `NotaryNodes` and create your proposal in your `fork`, commit it to your `fork`.  Make a pull request to the `NotaryNodes` repo you forked from.   This is the forking workflow of git - please become used to it, Notary Node Operators use it a lot.
