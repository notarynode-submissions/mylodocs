If you’re elected as a Notary Node Operator, you will take part in notarizing all the coins and assetchains that secure themselves with delayed Proof of Work (dPoW). Once your node is elected, it is important to keep the Notary Node up-to-date and to ensure that it is notarizing as often as possible.

In order for a chain to be notarized, Notary Nodes need to make a transaction that stores notarization data onto that blockchain. Just like any other transaction, a small fee is required to make a notarization transaction. It is therefore important to make sure you have a small supply of each coin and to make sure that all the coin daemons are up and running on your node. Newly-added coins are installed and synchronized swiftly, to ensure that the new coin is notarized as soon as possible.

Being a notary makes you part of the Komodo Platform. Although it is not necessary, it would be in your best interest to help the Komodo ecosystem and/or your fellow notaries as much as possible. Some examples of this are: help testing new tech that is being developed, writing helpful scripts for other notaries to use, or developing new services that help the Komodo Platform forward.

It is also in your best interest to participate in as many notarizations as possible because, if your node is among the top 50% in your region, it will be automatically re-elected for a new notary season. That also means that your node gets to have another year of income, around 1500KMD a month.

All of this requires knowledge of Linux and being comfortable working with the Command Line. Installing a blockchain, synchronizing it, setting up the notary software, management of wallets, improving the node's connectivity to other nodes (networking), monitoring; it's all part of a normal day in the life of a Notary Node Operator.
