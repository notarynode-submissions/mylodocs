Delayed proof of work (dPoW) is an innovative security mechanism that uses a series of cross-chain notarizations to protect every integrated blockchain with the power of the Bitcoin hash rate. Created by Komodo’s Lead Developer James ‘jl777’ Lee, dPoW is used to secure blockchains in the Komodo ecosystem as well as external third-party blockchains that wish to improve security. 

dPoW differs from a consensus mechanism in that it does not dictate how a blockchain’s network approves transactions or generates blocks. Rather, dPoW allows the network to come to consensus according to its established rules and then makes that agreed-upon history of transactions completely immutable.
