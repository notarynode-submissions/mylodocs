A notarization is the process of storing important blockchain data from one blockchain onto the ledger of a separate blockchain. In particular, the data includes a block hash, the corresponding block hash, and the name of the blockchain to which they belong.

Notarizations are carried out by performing a transaction on a blockchain and using the OP_Return command, which allows a small amount of data to be saved onto a blockchain’s ledger along with the other essential data for that transaction. 

Notarizations are the backbone of the delayed proof of work (dPoW) security mechanism.

As the name suggests, Komodo’s Notary Nodes are responsible for making notarizations throughout the Komodo ecosystem.
