An assetchain is a runtime fork of Komodo.

A runtime fork means that the source code of the executable binary remains the same, but users can enable a variety of optional, customizable parameters on launch, creating an independent blockchain right out of the box.

Launching an assetchain does **not**:
* require running the Komodo blockchain.
* issue a token tied to the Komodo blockchain (like Ethereum tokens), meaning assetchains are completely autonomous.
* require sending KMD coins to keep it running or paying transaction fees in KMD.
* have any of the limitations that smart contract platforms enforce on the token holders, offering absolute freedom to govern and develop your own blockchain project without constraints.

With assetchains, dPoW security integration support comes built-in by default, though activating it is optional. Activating dPoW is as easy as applying to be added to the Notary Node network, along with a nominal payment (partially in KMD, partially in the assetchain's native token) to cover the costs of notarization transactions.
