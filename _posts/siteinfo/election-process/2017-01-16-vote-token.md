A special VOTE token is used to conduct the voting for Komodo’s Notary Node election.

For each annual election, a new VOTE token is generated and airdropped at a 1:1 ratio to all KMD holders. Both the snapshot and airdrop will take place on April 14, 2019. VOTE tokens from previous years’ elections cannot be used.

The tokens can be accessed with the same seed phrase or private key (WIF) for the address in which you store your KMD coins.

For those who store thier KMD in Agama Lite Mode, simply restore your wallet and activate the VOTE token after the airdrop has taken place. 

For those who store their KMD in Agama in Native Mode, the easiest way to access VOTE tokens is to export the private key in WIF (wallet import format). Then simply enter the WIF as the passphrase for Agama Lite Mode and activate the VOTE token.

KMD holders who store their funds on a hardware wallet, such as a Trezor or Ledger device, will need to export their private key in wallet import format (WIF) and import that key to Agama wallet in order to access their VOTE tokens and cast their ballot.

Please note that users who store their KMD on an exchange will not receive VOTE coins. Storing your assets on an exchange makes it impossible to hold your own private keys, and thus impossible to receive any coin or token from an airdrop, including VOTE tokens.
